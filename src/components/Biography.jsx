                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>With a diverse background in the financial and property management/construction industries, I bring a multifaceted perspective to software engineering. My passion lies in creating and buildingâ€”whether it&apos;s developing a website, crafting an app, or constructing home additions. I am committed to excellence and take great pride in delivering high-quality work.</p>
                    <p>Based in Hawthorne, NJ, just 30 minutes from NYC, I enjoy engaging in DIY projects, gardening, hiking, camping with my family, and reading in my hammock during my free time.</p>
